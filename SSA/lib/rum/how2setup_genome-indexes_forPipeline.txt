How to create indexes for the RUM pipeline:
------------------------------------------

Go to UCSC, choose the organism and build.
Go to Table Browser:

group: all tables
table: chromInfo
output format: selected fields from primary and related tables
output file: chromosome_sizes.txt
hit "get output" and choose the 'chrom' and 'size' fields.

remove the header line (if any) and add columns so rows look like this:

chr1    0       249250621       +
chr2    0       181748087	+
....

in other words, add a column with '0' between the chr and size cols, and add a col with '+' at the end

* The next steps get fasta file with the complete genome sequence.

Submit the file from the previous step to the genome browser as a custom track, then go to table browser
and set as follows:

group: custom tracks
track: User Track
region: genome
output format: sequence
output file: NAME_genome.txt
file type returned: gzip

where "NAME" should be replaced by something that identifies your name/build, eg mm9

Hit get output, and request all upper case

gunzip the file and run:

> perl modify_fasta_header_for_genome_seq_database.pl NAME_genome.txt > NAME_genome.fa
> perl modify_fa_to_have_seq_on_one_line.pl NAME_genome.fa > NAME_genome_one-line-seqs.fa

Now need to make files of gene info and sequence:
 - you can use any of the annotation tracks as long as they have the five fields you are asked to select below:
 - the following illustrates using two tracks "UCSC Known" and "RefSeq".  

Set the table browser as follows:

group: Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks
track: UCSC Genes (or whatever track you like)
table: knownGene (or whatever is the corresponding name for the track you chose)
region: genome
output format: selected fields from primary and related tables
output file: ucscknown.txt (keep the name of this file simple)

Hit "get output"

Select the following fields from the table:
name
chrom
strand
exonStarts
exonEnds

hit "get output".

Now do the same thing but get RefSeq genes, save to file called: refseq.txt
  - Set 'table' to be "refGene".

make a file called "gene_info_files" with one line per gene annotation filename:
--------------
ucscknown.txt
refseq.txt

Now run:

> perl create_gene_indexes.pl NAME_refseq_ucscknown NAME_genome.fa 
  - this is a master script that runs seven other scripts...
  - you will need a fair amount of RAM to do this, 10Gb was sufficient for Human

Now build bowtie indexes:

> bowtie-build NAME_refseq_ucscknown_genes.fa NAME_genes
> bowtie-build NAME_genome.fa NAME_genome

Make the ooc file:

blat NAME_genome_sequence.fa /dev/null /dev/null -tileSize=11 -makeOoc=11.ooc_NAME -repMatch=1024

The files you need to keep are the following 14:

NAME_reefseq_ucscknown_gene_info.txt
NAME_genome_one-line-seqs.fa
NAME_genes.4.ebwt
NAME_genes.3.ebwt
NAME_genes.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.1.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.4.ebwt
NAME_genome.3.ebwt
NAME_genome.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.1.ebwt
